            <h2 class="point">1. Practice Simplicity</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Life’s a brutal mess, and simplicity is your blade to cut through it. Strip away the garbage—fancy toys, fake clout, all the crap society shoves down your throat. 
     	Stoics like Seneca knew: you’re born, you die, and most of what’s in between is noise. You don’t need more; you need less. Food to not starve, a roof to not freeze, and your own head to think—that’s it. Everything else is a distraction from the fight. Cling to nothing, chase nothing.
	 When you own only what you can carry in your soul, the world can’t touch you. Simplify, or drown.</p>
            <h2 class="point">2. Daily Reflection</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Emotions are a storm—wild, loud, and ready to wreck you. Stoics like Marcus Aurelius didn’t play that game. 
			You don’t get to whine or rage; you get to stand there, cold as death, and take it. Feelings don’t rule you—they’re shadows, fleeting, weak. Some punk screws you over? 
			Your gut screams to smash something? Stop. Breathe. Epictetus said it: it’s not what happens, it’s what you think about it that kills you. Chain your mind to reason, not chaos. Every time you don’t break, you’re stronger.
			 Lose control, and you’re already dead inside. Master it, or be its slave</p>
            <h2 class="point">3. Master Emotions</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Every night, face the mirror of your own existence. No excuses, no lies—just you and the truth. Stoics like Marcus didn’t waste a day without asking: What did I do? What did I fail? How do I not rot tomorrow? This isn’t some soft self-help trick—it’s judgment. Did you falter? Did you let weakness win? Write it down, burn it into your brain, and swear to fix it. Miss this, and you’re blind, stumbling toward the grave. Reflect like your life’s on the line—because it is. Time’s running out, bro. Stare it down.

	This is the Stoic code, raw and unyielding. For a web page, it’s a slap in the face—simplicity to survive, mastery to endure, reflection to prevail. 
	No fluff, no mercy. Live it, or don’t bother.</p>
